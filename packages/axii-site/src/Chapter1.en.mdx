# Using Reactive Data
 - Use `atom` to make non-object data like `string`/`number`/`boolean` reactive. Object which do not need deep watch can use it too.
 - use `.value` to get and set value of data created by using `atom`. Don't use `.value` to bind data to element property.
 - Use `computed` to create computed value.

<Tips content="Axii only update element which use a reactive data as children or property, which means component only render once if the references of component props is not changed." />
